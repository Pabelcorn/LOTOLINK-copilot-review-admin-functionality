## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. Make them executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh
   ```

2. Add a shebang at the top:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

3. Document them in this README

4. Add error handling:
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on error
   set -u  # Exit on undefined variable
   ```

5. Provide clear output messages

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Use functions for reusable code
- Provide help text with `-h` or `--help`
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 = success, non-zero = error)
- Use colors for better readability (see preflight-check.sh)
- Validate inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
